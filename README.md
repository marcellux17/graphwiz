# Graphwiz
My purpose with this small project was purely educational:
I wanted to learn and experiment with TypeScript and also practice my algorithmic skills. I used OOP methodology for clarity and modularity.
This project is by no means perfect and can be improved in many ways - both in terms of code clarity and performance.

I hope you enjoy learning about these cool graph algorithms as much as I enjoyed implementing them!
